Client Protocol 
This page describes the messaging between the wifidog client and auth server once a user has been validated and permitted access to the internet. It is client level messaging and not node level as described in the Server Heartbeat.
Periodically the wifidog client will start a thread to report the status of each user connection. Currently this is used to reporting incoming/outgoing counters for each user, and to show that the user is still connected.
The following message is sent for each connected user
auth_server:/auth/index.php?stage=countersip=mac=token=incoming=outgoing=
In response the auth server will respond with a valid status, and a new user message, or an auth server error.
The format of the response should be:
Auth: <number from user status list>
The new user status can be:
0 - AUTH_DENIED - User firewall users are deleted and the user removed.6 - AUTH_VALIDATION_FAILED - User email validation timeout has occured and user/firewall is deleted1 - AUTH_ALLOWED - User was valid, add firewall rules if not present5 - AUTH_VALIDATION - Permit user access to email to get validation email under default rules-1 - AUTH_ERROR - An error occurred during the validation process
auth server errors do not currently change firewall or user status.
Custom versions of the auth server set auth_DENIED when they wish to timeout a user, or close a node etc, to force the user to be terminated.
Browser redirects by the gateway
The client browser is going to be redirected to another page in different circumstances:
On the initial request:
Upon capture, the client will be redirected to the following URL by the gateway:

   * login?gw_address=%s&gw_port=%d&gw_id=%s&url=%s

After the initial request
Once the login request is processed and client has been redirected to the gateway
If server returned AUTH_DENIED: Note that you will normally never see that one in the standard auth server. The client won't be redirected back to the gateway.

   * gw_message.php?message=denied

If server returned AUTH_VALIDATION:

   * gw_message.php?message=activate

If server returned AUTH_ALLOWED: This is the portal redirect

   * portal/?gw_id=%s

If server returned AUTH_VALIDATION_FAILED: Note that you will normally never see that one in the standard auth server. The client won't be redirected back to the gateway.

   * gw_message.php?message=failed_validation
